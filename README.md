# Interstellar

The Objective of these project is to create an angry birds in space game using the "pygame" library in python.
The game involves launching rockets at the aliens in order to destroy them, while the player can use the gravitational force to hit them.
There are two levels of difficulties, a easy one and a hard one!

# Q&A:

Q: How do I run the program?<br>
A: To run the program you just need to download the zip from our code or clone our project, add it to Visual Code Studio and click the button "RUN". Simple as that!

Q: How do I play the game?<br>
A: In the Menu of the game there is the options button, if you click it there will be instructions on how to play the game!


# Mathematical description of the physical model:

We added a gravitational attractor, at a point on the screen. By doing this, the celestial body is exerting gravitational attraction on our rocket. When this happens, the resulting acceleration on each rocket is the (vector) sum of each of the attractions due to the individual celestial bodies.
